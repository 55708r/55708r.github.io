#### Open Science at MBCS Initiative

The Open Science at MBCS Initiative aims to self-educate and empower fellow students of the Master in Brain and Cognitive Sciences (MBCS; University of Amsterdam) to develop research-related decision-making and critical thinking skills. 

I am the founder and the current chair of the initiative. We are a team of 8 students.

To date, we have published an article for the ABC Journal on motivations for Open Science/Good Research Practices, consulted the MBCS program in revising courses to increase attention for research practices and student critical thinking, conducted a workshop on OS essentials for students.

#### Interactions

With a group of artists and scientists, we create and experiment with techniques for collective creative thinking and explore applications to scientific practice. The collective is hosted by the Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Amsterdam.
