How we see the world — its present, past, and possible futures — determines how we act in it. 

How do we then see and understand the world? I am interested in the development, formation, and revision of complex belief structures such as attitudes or explanations. I am also interested in how these structures relate to our behaviour and constrain our inferences.

To approach these topics, I combine computational cognitive modelling and empirical methods such as cognitive/behavioural experiments. 

<!--My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles.

My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions such as advertising, pricing and targeting by developing algorithmic products that turn big unstructured data into actionable insights.
