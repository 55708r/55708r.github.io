How we see the world — its present, past, and possible futures — determines how we act in it. 

How do we then see and understand the world? I am interested in the development, formation, and revision of complex belief structures such as attitudes, explanations, or theories. I am also interested in how these structures relate to our behavior and constrain our inferences.

To approach these topics, I combine computational cognitive modeling and empirical methods such as cognitive-behavioral experiments. 

Currently, I am studying people’s preferences for explanations that appeal to different causal structures of social phenomena. I am fortunate to conduct this study at the CoCoDev lab at Harvard University, under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Tomer Ullman, and with the inspiring company of other CoCoDev lab members. 

I have also built a computational model of interacting cognitive processes that generate attitudes. This project was supervised by Prof. Han van der Maas (Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam) and Casper Hesp (Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam; University College London), advised by Prof. Karl Friston (University College London), and hosted by the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS; University of Amsterdam) as a part of the IAS Excellence Students program.

<!--My current research combines tools in econometrics, machine learning and leverages unstructured data (e.g., video, text, map and network) to optimize marketing decisions and answer questions of general interest in social sciences. I’m also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic psychological and neurological principles.
One stream of my current work focuses on combining machine learning and adaptive experimentation to personalize marketing interventions. Another one centers on extracting insights from unstructured data such as video (images, audios and text), map and network in observational studies. I'm also interested in understanding consumer behaviors through the lens of basic economic and psychological principles.

My current research focuses on optimizing managerial decisions such as advertising, pricing and targeting by developing algorithmic products that turn big unstructured data into actionable insights.
