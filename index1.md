How we see the world — its present, past, and possible futures — determines how we act in it. 

How do we then see and understand the world? I am interested in the development, formation, and revision of complex belief structures such as attitudes or explanations. I am also interested in how these structures relate to our behaviour and constrain our inferences.

To approach these topics, I combine computational cognitive modelling and empirical methods such as behavioural experiments. 

Currently, I am studying people’s preferences for explanations that appeal to different causal structures of social phenomena. I am fortunate to conduct this study at the CoCoDev lab at Harvard University, under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Tomer Ullman, and with the inspiring company of other CoCoDev lab members. 

I have also built a computational model of interacting cognitive processes that generate attitudes. This project was supervised by Prof. Han van der Maas (Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam) and Casper Hesp (Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam; University College London), advised by Prof. Karl Friston (University College London), and hosted by the Institute of Advanced Study (IAS; University of Amsterdam) as a part of the IAS Excellence Students program.
