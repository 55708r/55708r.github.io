I am holding regular virtual office hours for anyone who has questions about my research, the process of applying to PhD programs, or graduate school more generally. I am particularly interested in supporting underrepresented minorities in these pursuits, and I welcome anyone who is interested in discussing these topics with me. 

To schedule a meeting, use this [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/i-jonusaite/30min). Please also follow-up your booking with an email (provided in the Calendly form), specifying what you'd like to discuss during the session, and to confirm your booking with me.
